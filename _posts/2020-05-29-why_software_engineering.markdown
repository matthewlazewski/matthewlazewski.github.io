I have always been fascinated by computers. How they work, the parts that go into them, and how much they can do. When I was a kid, any time something wasn’t working on our home computers my parents would call on me to try to fix it. I may have only been in elementary school and had no idea what I was doing, but after clicking a few things and downloading something (and probably deleting other things in the process), I would almost always fix it somehow.

As I got older I still used them and was good with them, but never thought to pursue it any further than fixing issues on my own laptop and never learning why something was working. I got into the restaurant industry at 16 and never looked back. It was all I knew. I was good at it and I had fun doing it. I even got earned a bachelor’s degree in Hospitality Management. They always joked in school about working long nights, weekends, and holidays but at the time I was too stubborn to know what that really entailed. I took a job right after school and immediately felt every bit of that. I worked constantly. I missed family dinners, holidays, special events, everything. I never saw my family and friends and when I did I was too tired to enjoy it.

Coding always interested me, but it felt too broad and I had no idea where to even start. It was something I really wanted to do but just didn’t know how, and also I was scared to leave behind the only business I had ever known. I remember riding to the airport at 3:00 am the day after Thanksgiving so I could catch the earliest flight back home to get to work. My family had big plans that day but I had to miss them. It dawned on me then I needed a change. I immediately got on google and simply searched “Learn to Code”. It pointed me to an app that taught basic HTML, CSS, and Javascript. I downloaded it immediately and was hooked. It was all I did for weeks in my free time. It was so cool to see something so simple make something so elegant. I eventually did some more research and discovered bootcamps and knew that was what I needed to do. I hatched a plan to save up, leave my job, and eventually pursue software engineering full-time.
